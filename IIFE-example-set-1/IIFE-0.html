        // Imagine that you have a game, with a `playerName` and a `highScore` you are keeping track of
        // `playerName` is in "global scope" with all of the built-in browser symbols,
        // and is thus visible on this entire script, and from any other script.
        // `highScore` is in "script scope", and thus visible on this entire script, and
        // from any other script. 
        // Go ahead and change these values from the console - not too secure, eh?
        // The players can raise their high score to anything they want to!

    <p>
        No IIFE! Everything is public and visible! Go ahead and try modifying both `playerName` and `highScore` in the
        console!
